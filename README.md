# Sketchbook
## Description

A digital sketchbook to host my attempts at learning to draw figures, portraits, and little doodles here and there as a break from my studies.

All images and data are stored in a MongoDB database and retreived using a NodeJS/Express API on the server-side.

**Note:** I'm using free hosting and database services so that's why it takes a while on the initial load-up.
